            <p class="text-start">
              Most of you reading this article, may or may not know the answers to the above questions and honestly, I don’t blame you. Fact is that despite being a little over 100 years old, Psychology is still a relatively new field in comparison to other fields like physics, biology, engineering, chemistry, mathematics, etc.

              Even in the 21st century, there are a lot of myths and stereotypes surrounding psychology and the field of
              mental health. In this article I am going to answer the above questions and also give you a number of
              reasons why you should take an interest in psychology.
  
              What is psychology?
              Psychology is the scientific study of human and animal behavior, emotions and thought (cognitive) processes.
              It is a scientific field established to understand behavior, thinking and emotions amongst different
              species. A discipline that tries to understand how the mind works. It tries to explain how a person might
              function alone or in a group. Mental health is a discipline within psychology.

                Is psychology only for those who are mad and for those who want to treat mad people?
                As mentioned above, psychology is a scientific study of behavior, cognition, and emotions among various
                species. Psychology is not at all limited to people with mental illnesses or those whom we tend to call
                ‘Mad’. Similarly, the people who study psychology or psychiatry, not only treat those with mental
                illnesses, but also work in several other fields with numerous other roles and responsibilities.
  
                Let’s get some more insight into the work done by psychologists & mental health professionals!
  
                After studying psychology, professionally what does an individual do?
                Over the decades, the field of psychology and the work of psychologists has spread across multiple areas
                of our human lives. The American Psychological Association (APA) which is one of the strongest
                professional bodies of psychologists has divisions of psychology which are more than 50 in number. Besides
                the APA, there are numerous other bodies or associations that focus on Psychology, like British
                Psychological Society, Spanish Psychological Association, Australian Psychological Society, Indian
                Psychological Association, Federation of German Psychologist’s Association etc. Here are some of the areas
                where psychologists work:
                Clinical Psychology- It focuses on the study of mental disorders, diagnosis, causes and treatment of
                disorders are explored.
